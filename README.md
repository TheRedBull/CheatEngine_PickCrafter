# CheatEngine_PickCrafter

***Updated for 5.9***

I take no credit for the original work done here - just wanted to play around with getting this working and bump this up to the latest ;)


NOTEWORTHY CHANGES:
- 'block drops' set to +255 for less annoying (prestige) power leveling
- Currencies are working but are not one-click activation (read the \<script\> in that record for details)

### TROUBLESHOOTING:
Can't find the correct memory block?
- See [Issue #1](https://github.com/TheRedBull/CheatEngine_PickCrafter/issues/1)
